                <p> The University Rover Challenge is a competition held every year by a few NASA employees
                    where many universities are tasked to build a fully functional Mars rover. 
                    I am a member of Pitt's Society of Astronautics and Robotics (SOAR) where we
                    are tackling this challenge.

                <p class="multLines">I am currently the software leader for our team, and I direct and 
                    organize a team of 5. Throughout my time working on this competition, I have
                    developed the motor control, wired the components, 
                    utilized information from different sensors, and created GUIs. Through this project,
                    I have learned how to utilize a ROS environment with a Linux system. I have also 
                    expanded my knowledge of Arduino, electronics, and coding languages.

                <p>Within Pitt's Robotics Automation Society (RAS), I work on
                    the micromouse team. Micromouse is a competition where teams build
                    a mouse-sized robot that can autonomously navigate a maze in the shortest
                    possible time.

                     My role in this team is to work with the other electrical subteam members
                     to build a working prototype of the robot using Arduino boards and code. Specifically, 
                     I directly contributed to picking the components that we are using. I also put all of those components
                     together on a breadboard for testing. In the process, I also had to communicate
                     with the other subteams to ensure compatibility.

                <p>The Drone Challenge is a competition within the organization called TSA or Technology
                    Student Association.
                    The competition task was to build a fully functional drone with a programmable claw
                    to pick up a payload. We then had to traverse an obstacle course with the payload.
                    We earned points by picking up the payload, successfully traversing the obstacles, and dropping
                    the payload in the designated location.
                    My team placed first in a competition of around 40 teams in the state of Pennsylvania.

                    For this competition, I learned how to use CAD software, 3D printing, laser cutting,
                    and how to manage a budget (we could only use $500).
